* dataset contains training and testing images separated by class.

* bof.pkl contains the trained classifier, where training is supposedly done offline, among other essential objects for classification.

* To test VLR, run VLRTest.py in the test directory. Usage: "python VLRTest.py".

* VLRTestInput.py contains image paths on each row, where the corresponding row in VLRTestOutput.py contains the ground-truth label.

* VLR.py contains functions for extracting feature descriptors, preprocessing features, perform training on the feature matrix, then using the generated classifier to perform prediction.

* Output of execute function returns the predicted label in string format.
