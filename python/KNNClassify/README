Cough Detection from Audio Data:

-KNN Classifier is used to detect Cough from Audio data. 
-The KNN Classifier is built with k=11 and model is fit using inputs and targets provided in lpcInputTarget.csv 
-The feature vector used is LPC with order = 10. Total 60 different sound files are used as training data for KNN Classifier. 
-Each training data is of 1 sec, there are 30 sound files of cough and remaining 30 sound files of non-cough. 
-From each sound data we calculate LPC feature vector of order 10.

Dependencies:
1. Numpy
2. Scipy --> scipy.io and scipy.signal
3. Sklearn --> Sklearn.neighbours
4. csv

Steps to Run Code:
1. Run main.py file present in KNNClassify folder.

Inputs:
Ten audio files present in testData folder in KNNClassify folder.

Output:
results - A list with length 10 containing 0 for No Cough and 1 for Cough Prediction
