* To test ALPR, run ALPRTest.py in the test directory. Usage: "python ALPRTest.py".

* ALPRTestInput.py contains video paths on each row, where the corresponding row in ALPRTestOutput.py contains the ground-truth label.

* ALPR.py contains only functions for classifying using the pre-trained OpenALPR classifier. No training is done.

* Output of execute function returns a matrix: each row represents a frame that was processed, with the number of columns being n, the number of highest confident predictions.
Thus, each row gives at most n predictions.

* During validation, the best prediction (according to edit distance) for each frame is used to compare against the ground-truth label, where the error is accumulated.

* LED avg denotes the average Levenshtein error distance per frame during recognition.
